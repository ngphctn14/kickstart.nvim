these are notes for myself in case i forgot some keybindings for this nvim setup.

<C-g>: toggle nvim-tree
space fb: telescope file browser
<leader> /: fuzzy find within the file
<C-<leader>>: open terminal
<leader>-<leader>: lists existing buffers
<leader> b: compile and run code
<leader> c: copmile code
<leader> r: run code
<alt-123456789>: open the buffer corresponding to its position (left to right)
<alt-c>: close the buffer
<alt->>: move right
<alt-<>: move left
<alt-shift->>: move the opening buffer to the right by 1
<alt-shift-<>: move the opening buffer to the left by 1
